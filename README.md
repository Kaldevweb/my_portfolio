It's the repo of my portfolio. You can check it [HERE](http://www.kevinahloye.com)

I made it by my own.

You can see & check all my code that I used for the development of my portfolio.

I used Gulp for managing, packaging, optimizing all static files (images, video, javascript files, css...)

I used Npm for managing my development environment

I deployed my portfolio on Heroku (Cloud Host)
